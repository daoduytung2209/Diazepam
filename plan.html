 <li><strong>About Us</strong>: Hello and welcome! I am the founder of DiazePam Cafe and i go by the name of Adib. DiazePam Cafe was founded in 2009 and is still ongoing. I graduated from Polytechnic so that gave me the skills to start this Business. Well, it was challenging at first but as times passes by, my Cafe gain more attention amongst people and hopefully my next plan is to set up another branch elsewhere. My parents have been really supportive of me doing this business and constantly helping me with developing and introducing new concepts to this business. Without them, Diazepam Cafe would not be the way it is now. More about me. My hobbies are playing music including the guitar and drums which i enjoy most as well as playing sports such as soccer and hockey. Music has always been a part of me since young and i always had ambitions of pursuing it as career, however i play it as a hobby now and i have my own band and we intend to play more gigs in Singapore.   
<p>We in DiazePam Café live and breathe ice cream and desserts. We are an independent icecream and desserts café based in Singapore. With the large variety of flavours to choose from that will keep you thinking what to get, we assure you the best quality in our food as well as service, it aims to provide the highest quality ice-cream.
The café was started as a small local setup and has grown to have 5 outlets in Singapore.  </p>
